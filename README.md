# Pneumonia Detection with Swin Transformer

This project implements a deep learning model based on **Swin Transformer** for detecting **Pneumonia** from chest X-ray images.  
It uses the publicly available **Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Dataset** (Kaggle) and leverages PyTorch with data augmentation, transfer learning, and comprehensive evaluation metrics.

## üìä Key Results
- **Best Validation Accuracy:** 98.95%
- **Test Accuracy:** 76.60%
- **Sensitivity (Recall for Pneumonia):** 0.9974
- **Specificity (Recall for Normal):** 0.3803
- **Precision (Weighted):** 82.61%
- **F1 Score (Weighted):** 73.22%

The model demonstrates very strong sensitivity in detecting pneumonia but struggles with specificity for normal cases ‚Äî a common challenge in medical image classification.

## üöÄ Features
- **Data Augmentation**: Random flips, rotations, color jitter.
- **Model**: Swin Transformer (`swin_tiny_patch4_window7_224`) pretrained on ImageNet.
- **Training Enhancements**: AdamW optimizer, ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler.
- **Visualization**: Training/validation curves, confusion matrix.
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Sensitivity, Specificity.

üß™ Limitations

High sensitivity but lower specificity (tends to misclassify normal X-rays as pneumonia).

Performance could be improved with:

More balanced dataset

Advanced preprocessing
